# Dotfiles

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as a centralized place to:

1.  **Backup:** Keep a safe copy of my personal configuration settings.
2.  **Synchronize:** Easily replicate my preferred environment across multiple machines.
3.  **Version Control:** Track changes made to my configurations over time using Git.
4.  **Reference:** Act as a personal reference and potentially provide inspiration for others setting up their own systems.

These dotfiles are personalized for my own workflow and system setup. Feel free to browse and take inspiration, but use them at your own risk. Directly cloning and using these configurations might require modifications to work correctly on your system
